To Estimate Speed
 - Create LUT for each track of (Percent Change to distance)
 - Use automatic detection using Disk telemetry
 - Find Distance of track and use that in calculations (All Relative?)

Overall Design

 - Use SDK to save state throughout race (like check 1/min)
 - Use SDK to log telemetry for all cars in Session
 - Use SDK to Create LUT of Teams/Cars/Classes/Drivers
