# (ARCHIVE) WSR-Stats-API
TFRLabs but better and Internal to WSR Esports

### Ideas
- Fancy Front End behind login page
- Uses iR API to process results of specified events or even private hosted sessions
- Organizes stats by event
- Do all the stats TFRLabs does and much more
- More Visualization than TFRLabs


### Technical Ideas
- What web stack are we using
- Probably python3 for the backend
- some sort of login database with like 3 different levels of perms
- Get to level of TFR Labs First then add features
