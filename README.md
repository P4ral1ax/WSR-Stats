# Puresims-Stats
TFRLabs but better and Internal to Puresims

### Ideas
- Fancy Front End behind login page for Puresims People
- Uses iR API to process results of specified events or even private hosted sessions
- Organizes stats by event
- Do all the stats TFRLabs does and much more
- More Visualization than TFRLabs


### Technical Ideas
- What web stack are we using
- Probably python3 for the backend
- some sort of login database with like 3 different levels of perms
